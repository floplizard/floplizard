Extensions for the Dropwizard 0.7.x Framework.

## floplizard-guice - _"The missing Guice support for Dropwizard"_

### Why not (yet?) Dropwizard 0.8.x?

Dropwizard 0.8.x chose to switch to Jersey 2 which is notoriously
difficult to use with any dependency injection framework besides the
(builtin and not used anywhere else) HK2. Patches are welcome to
mitigate this.
